Today was the day, the culmination of a lot of work in such a short amount of time. I think our team sprinted for that last quarter mile and brought home a win.
We did have a few flaws in our final demo:
* No user accounts, the UI and APIs worked fine we just ran out of time to figure out what was going on in that Java file.
* Lack of user accounts meant no owners to post notifications.
* A simple null check would have prevented our app from crashing on empty Admission Fee input.

But, I think our map functionality and the venue page carried our app to success.
I personally think I might finish out the app over the summer, almost worth the Google Cloud Server costs just to see how people use it.
