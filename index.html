<h1>Bar Queue App</h1>
<!-- Project Perspective -->
<p>
The app it directed to the viewpoint of the outgoers that like to go out on days where bars or restaurants are giving specials on that day, or for those that like to sit down and enjoy their meal with other associates but donâ€™t want to have to wait very long to be able to sit. It also gives the perspective of those that want to go and have a drink or go to a night event that may have a big crowd and admission fee.
</p>
<!--  -->
<p>
It is powered using Google Maps Android API, but due to limitations of Google Places API for Android, it actually uses Google Places API Web Service. The data we've accumulated, wait times, admission fees, and notifications, is stored on mongoDB with a nodeJS custom API. We deployed this mongoDB/nodeJS combination on a Google Cloud Compute Engine running Windows Server 2016. 
</p>
<h1>Importance</h1>
<p>
This solution is needed due to the aspects that lines can be long for specific bars or restaurants. Also you would not want to be blindsided by admission fees or you arrive to the location of your desire just to find out that the establishment is closed.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this app is to provide more accuracy with ease to specific bars or restaurants that are in the surrounding area in the categories of admission fees, popularity, wait times, gender ratio, open/close times, and possible specials that are being given by each establishment.
</p>
<p>
We want to serve both the customer and business owner in a way that they have experienced in the past.
