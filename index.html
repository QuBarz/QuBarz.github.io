<h1>Bar Queue App</h1>
<!-- Project Perspective -->
<p>
The app it directed to the viewpoint of the outgoers that like to go out on days where bars or restaurants are giving specials on that day, or for those that like to sit down and enjoy their meal with other associates but donâ€™t want to have to wait very long to be able to sit. It also gives the perspective of those that want to go and have a drink or go to a night event that may have a big crowd and admission fee.
